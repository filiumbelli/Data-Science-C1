# Combinatorics
Permutation
- Unique way of an event to happen in a finite space
Variations
- V = number of elements ^ positions to fill  -> Repetitive actions
- V = number of elements! / (number of elements - elements to arrange) 
Combination
- Permutation of combination cares about the occurence order of event.
- On the other hand combination does not effected from permutation
- Variation / Permutation Effect = Combination
- In Example of 10 possible value for 3 place. Combination = (Permutation= 10!/((10-3)!)  * (Order of occurence)3!) 
Symmetry of Combinations
- Picking p many elements in as many ways as picking n - p many elements are the same
- Comb. of 10 elements with 8 is the same as Comb. of 10 elements with 2 is the same.
- Apply symmetry to calculate combination of big numbers   
Calculating the combination of different Events
- Every event and their combination is taken as a different space
- Every possible selection is multiplied to create the sum of the space
