# Bayesian Inference
Sets & Subsets
- Representation of group of elements
- Sets can be used with the representation of the event
Independent Events
- The theoretical probabiltiy remains unaffected by other events.
Dependent Events
- Probabilty of an event can vary with a change in conditions
Notations of Dep|Indep events
- P(A|B) -> Probability of A to occur if B has occured
- P(A|B) = P(A n B) / P(B)
Law of Total Probability
- P(A) = P(A|B1) x P(B1) + P(A|B2) x P(B2) +...
Multiplication Rule
- P(A|B) x P(B) = P(A n B) 
# Bayes' Rule              
- Two events: A & B        
- P(A|B) = P(A n B) / P(B) => Multiplication rule
- P(A n B) = P(B|A) x P(A)
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) x P(A) / P(B)
